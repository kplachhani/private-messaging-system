## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. The api will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build:webpack` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
